# _Pig Latin String Translator_

#### _Turn an English string into Pig Latin, 24 Oct 2018_

#### By _**Robert Lee**_

## Description

_Write a string translator that turns English into Pig Latin.  To do this, impliment the following:

_1.  Break a user input string text into individual words._

_2.  Create a loop that will check all the words.  Check if the word starts with either a, e, i, o, or u.  If it does, move it to the end of the word, and add "way".

_3.  Check if the word starts with y.  If it does, move it to the end of the word, and add "ay".

_4.  Only words that start with constanants are left.  Check the word if "qu" occurs in the beginning.  If it does, move all the constanants including "qu" to the end of the word, and add "ay"._

_5.  The last check, take all the constanants at the beginning of the word up until the first vowell (a, e, i, o, u, or y), and move them to the end of the word.  Then add "ay"._

_6.  Take all the new Pig Latin words, and put them back together in one sentence.
